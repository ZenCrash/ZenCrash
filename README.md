* Iâ€™m currently working on 2 project
  - 1. Android app for audiobook management. 
        filemanagement,
        file status list (listning, On hold, Dropped, Planned)
        friends management.
        sql-lite intergration.
        friends tab/group.
  - 2. Unity project with a group.
        physics based game engion space game with build mechanics.
        honestly it seems more challing the programming based math, 
        and the creation of game assets, then the programming part
